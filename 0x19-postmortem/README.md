## __Project: 0x19. Postmortem__

Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, and human error… Failing is normal, and it is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to ensure that they won’t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.

A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

- To provide the rest of the company’s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
- And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.
