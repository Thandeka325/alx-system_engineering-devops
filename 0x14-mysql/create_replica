Step 1: Log in to MySQL 
On web-01, access MySQL:

mysql -u root -p
Enter your MySQL root password when prompted.

Step 2: Create the Replica User
Inside the MySQL prompt (mysql>), create the user:

CREATE USER 'replica_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourStrongPassword';

Replace 'YourStrongPassword' with a secure password of your choosing.

Step 3: Grant Replication Privileges

GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replica_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Step 4: Grant holberton_user Permission to Check Users
To allow holberton_user to check the list of users and their replication privileges:

GRANT SELECT ON mysql.user TO 'holberton_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Step 5: Verify the User and Permissions
Exit MySQL:
EXIT;

Now, log in as holberton_user and check the user list:

mysql -u holberton_user -p -e 'SELECT user, Repl_slave_priv FROM mysql.user'

Enter the password: projectcorrection280hbtn.
