step 1: Use the link given by ALX for installing mysql 5.7 on both the severs (web-01 and web-02)
sudo wget -O mysql57 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuuxcode/alx-system_engineering-devops/master/scripts/mysql57 && sudo chmod +x mysql57 &&  sudo ./mysql57

If you are using Ubuntu(Focal) it will prompt you to choose a compatibile programme use your keyboard arrow keys to nevigate to `ubuntu bionic`(it will be hilighted when you choose it) and press enter

The next promt will ask you to select the appropriate product to choose the version that you wish to receive. Just nevigate to `ok` and press enter.

Next prompt will ask for a password you can just press enter or write your desired password to use to login to mysql(advise to add password if you will use mysql -u root -p to access mysql on the server.

If your Ububtu system is compatibile with the version you are installing it will just take you directly to the password prompt.

Thats it you have installed MySQL on your web servers.
